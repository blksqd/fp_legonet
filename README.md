<h1> University of London Final Project: L.E.G.O Net - A hardware-restricted approach to training Melanoma classifiers </h1>


<h2> Abstract </h2>

<p>Melanona is one of the deadliest types of cancer if not detected earlier. The need for systems that support/enhance early detection is growing every day as the number of cases follows an upward trajectory. However, dermoscopic images are not always available, and even fewer in a labeled manner. This project aims to solve the hardware constraint, the class imbalance, and the lack of labeled data by taking an approach based on a simple mathematical approach: fractals. </p>
